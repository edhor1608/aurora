## Component Map

1. Identity and access layer (\`Better-Auth\` session lifecycle and membership resolution).
2. Domain core (\`packages/core\`) for deterministic policy and validation.
3. Realtime backend (\`convex\`) for data model, functions, and events.
4. Client apps (\`apps/web\`, \`apps/mobile\`).
5. Public API/SDK (\`packages/sdk\`) with versioned capabilities.
6. Media layer for upload policy and signed URL issuance.
7. Moderation/audit controls and abuse limits.
8. Minimal voice module (presence, join/leave, mute/deafen) with 25-user MVP target.

## Architecture Constraints

- Cloud mode: Convex Cloud EU primary.
- Voice mode: LiveKit Cloud EU.
- Self-host v1 packaging: Docker Compose only.
- API governance: full parity public API from day one.

## Key Data Flows

- Message send: client -> permissioned mutation -> append -> realtime subscription update.
- Attachment upload: client -> upload token -> storage -> attachment record.
- Moderation: report -> queue -> action -> immutable audit log.

This file mirrors locked product decisions from the Obsidian source of truth.

## Locked Decisions (Enforced)

| Decision | Locked Option | Enforced Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| D-101 | A | Convex Cloud EU region primary cloud operating model. Temporary fallback note: if EU region availability is blocked, release gating requires an explicit ADR before any non-EU fallback. |
| D-102 | A | LiveKit Cloud EU for MVP voice runtime. |
| D-103 | A | MVP voice stability target is exactly 25 concurrent users. |
| D-104 | B | Architecture target supports communities up to 100k members. |
| D-105 | A | AGPL-3.0 applies repo-wide. |
| D-106 | A | Full parity public API from day one. |
| D-107 | A | Self-host packaging in v1 is Docker Compose only. |
